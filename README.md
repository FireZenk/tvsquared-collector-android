tvsquared-collector-android
===========================

This the TVSquared collector Android integration code. This comprises a complete sample Android application which
demonstrates how to use the integration's API.

When integrating to your own code, the only file you actually need to include is "src/com/tvsquared/TVSquaredCollector.java".
All others are part of the sample application code.

To use the sample, you will need to change the &lt;COLLECTORHOSTNAME&gt; and &lt;COLLECTORSITEID&gt; in
"src/com/tvsquared/sample/SampleActivity.java" to the values as described on our website.
