tvsquared-collector-android
===========================

This the TVSquared collector Android integration code. This comprises a complete sample Android application which 
demonstrates how to use the integration's API.

When integrating to your own code, the only file you actually need to include is "src/com/tvsquared/TVSquaredCollector.java".
All others are part of the sample application code. 

To use the sample, you will need to change the &lt;COLLECTORHOSTNAME&gt; and &lt;COLLECTORSITEID>gt;in "src/com/tvsquared/sample/SampleActivity.java" to the values as described on our website.
